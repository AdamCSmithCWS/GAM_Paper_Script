# Improved status and trend estimates from the North American Breeding Bird Survey using a hierarchical Bayesian generalized additive model
 Note: everything in here is preliminary, and placed in this repository for my own use. I'm happy to receive helpful comments, but please don't fork this without talking to me first. It's evolving fast right now


The status and trend estimates derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), are critical sources of information for bird conservation. However, many of the varied uses of these estimates would be well served by some alternative models that are more sensitive to changes in the rates of population change through time, such as change points and cycles, and that allow for the sharing of information across the speciesâ€™ range, to improve regional estimates. Here we describe a hierarchical Bayesian generalized additive mixed-model (GAM) that fits these criteria and generates status and trend estimates with optimized for many common uses related to conservation assessments. We demonstrate the models with data for Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and some other species to demonstrate its benefits, and we run a full cross-validation of the GAM against two other BBS models to compare predictive fit among models. We used a 15-fold cross-validation approach, with we suggest provides a practical alternative to assessing predictive fit across the entire BBS dataset, while accounting for the spatial and temporal imbalances in the data. The GAMs have better predictive fit overall than the standard model for all species studied here, and better or comparable predictive fit in comparison to an alternative first difference model. In addition, the GAM with added random year-effects estimates a population trajectory that con be decomposed into a smooth component and the annual fluctuations around that smooth. This decomposition generates trend estimates that remove the annual fluctuations and are therefore more useful for the status assessments such as IUCN or COSEWIC. Estimated trajectories form the model can be visualized either with or without the annual fluctuations, to suit the particular inferential use for the estimates, such as visualizing patterns that may follow climatological cycles vs patterns that relate more to annual precipitation.

### Figure 1. Survey-wide population trajectories for Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) estimated from the BBS using two models described here that include a GAM smoothing function to model change over time (GAM and GAMYE) and a third trajectory estimated using the standard slope-based model used for BBS status and trend assessments since 2011 (SLOPE). The stacked dots along the x-axis indicate the approximate number of BBS counts used in the model; each dot represents 50 counts.
